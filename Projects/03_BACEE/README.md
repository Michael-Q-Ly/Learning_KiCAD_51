# Project 3: BACEE
- - - -
This repository contains the PCB design project from the book and course "[Kicad Like a Pro](https://techexplorations.com/so/kicada/)"

This project implements an Arduino-compatible board mostly using SMD components, and
I will be following Dr. Peter Dalmaris' online instruction to design this board.

The board will contain a micro controller, two EEPROM modules, a clock and calendar
module, two crystal oscillators, and several SMD-sized resistors, capacitors and LEDs.
In addition, it will include headers for connecting peripherals to the micro controller.

The name given to this board is BACEE because it is a "Battery-powered Arduino
with Clock and Extended EEPROM."

This project will combine concepts I learned from the previous two projects

## Learning Objectives

1. [ ] Explore Kicad's more powerful features such as splitting schematic diagrams into more than one sheet
2. [ ] Use an external autorouter
3. [ ] Convert a two-layer board into a four-layer board
