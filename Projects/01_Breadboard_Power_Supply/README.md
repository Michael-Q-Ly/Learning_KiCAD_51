# Project 1: Breadboard Power Supply

This is the first project from the book and video course [Kicad Like a Pro](https://techexplorations.com/so/kicada/), by Dr. Peter Dalmaris. It implements a simple breadboard power supply.

In this project, I follow Dr. Dalmaris's videos to create a double-sided PCB for a 5V power supply.
I will be learning the following by the end of this project:
1. [x] How to design a schematic of your board in Eeschema
2. [x] How to design a layout for your board with externally-imposed physical restrictions
3. [x] How to take measurements that relate to the boardâ€™s mechanical specifications and used them to design the board outline
4. [x] How to apply the linear schematic design workflow in a real project
5. [x] How to apply the linear layout design workflow in a real project
6. [x] How to select symbols from the library, and associate them with footprints
7. [x] How to manually route the board
8. [x] How to manufacture the board using an online manufacturer
